# Digital Image Processing

This is a small desktop application that I designed and implemented in 2013 as a course project. The idea was to experiment with different digital filters for image processing and to implement them from scratch, in order to understand the underlying mechanics such as 2D convolution and different kernels.

The programming language for this project is Java and the documentation is in Finnish.
